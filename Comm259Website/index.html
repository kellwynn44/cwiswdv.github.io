        <h2>Kiki's Delivery Service</h2>
            <p>
                My favorite childrens books growing up were the Dorrie the Witch
                series by Patricia Coombs, so it was probably inevitable that 
                Kiki's Delivery Service is one of my all-time favorite Studio 
                Ghibli movies.

        <h2>My Neighbor Totoro</h2>
            <p>
                I love this movie because the story is both poignant and funny, 
                there are so many great characters, and the animation is beautiful.

        <h2>Ponyo</h2>
            <p>
                This is the first Studio Ghibli film I remember watching with my children.
                Perhaps that is why it holds a special place in my heart.

            <p>
                I also love how excited Ponyo is about everything in the human world.
                It reminds me that the ordinary can be extraordinary, if we take the 
                time to notice it.
